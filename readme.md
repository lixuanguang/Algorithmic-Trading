# Quantitative Trading Encyclopedia

A big dream and project of mine to consolidate crucial quantitative trading knowledge in 3 domains (mathematics, finance, computer science) in a single repository, for open knowledge access.

As of current progress, only the following books are covered in the Notes section.

| Book | Author | Progress | Comments |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Time Series Analysis | James Douglas Hamilton | WIP on first chapter | For Mathematical Primer section |
| Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Strategies | Raja Velu | WIP on Univariate Time Series Models chapter | For Fundamentals of Systematic Trading section |
| Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives | John C. Hull | WIP on Interest Rate Futures chapter | For Derivatives Trading section |
| Inside the Black Box | Rishi K. Narang | Completed | Incorporated in Fundamentals of Systematic Trading section |
| Visual Studio Code for Python | April Speight | Completed | Incorporated in Appendix section |


The Project section which covers quantitative trading infrastructure, models, and strategies were only started in late January 2024, hence progress has been excruciatingly slow.

Will spend more time on the project once my schedule has freed up this year, as I am currently doing my semester while working full time.
