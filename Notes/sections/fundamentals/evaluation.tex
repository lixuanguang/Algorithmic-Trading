\subsection{Model Evaluation}

An evaluator's goal is to understand the strategy (risks, sources of returns), and to judge the fund manager.\\

Questions that may be asked to evaluate a fund manager's strategy is:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Research and strategy development: how new ideas are conceived; how the ideas are tested; what criteria the manager looks for in determining whether a strategy works or not
\item Data sourcing, gathering, cleaning, and management: what data is used; how is the data stored and why that way; how data is cleaned
\item Investment selection and structuring: are the alpha models theory-driven or data-driven; what alpha strategies are used (i.e., trend, reversion, value/yield, growth, or quality); are the bets relative or individual; if bets are relative, what does relative mean exactly; over what time horizon and in what investment universe; how the various alpha models are mixed
\item Portfolio construction: how portfolio construction is performed; what the the limits and why is it set that way; what are the inputs to portfolio construction; what is the objective function or goal
\item Execution: what kind of transaction model is used, and why is it chosen; how are the trades executed (manually or algorithmically); are the order execution algorithms hidden or visible, active or passive
\item Risk management and monitoring: what does the risk model account for, and why these things; what are the various risk limits, and why are these set that way; under what circumstances will there be a need to intervene with the model; what is being monitored on an ongoing basis
\end{enumerate}

Types of edge a portfolio manager may have is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]

\item Investment process edge: the quality of processes, of people (how adversity is dealt with)
\item Data edge: proprietary access to some sort of data, through superior data gathering, cleaning, storage
\item Lack-of-competition edge: not long lasting. More competitive means more cyclical trading space.
\item Structural edge: market structure related, caused and removed by regulation
\end{enumerate}

Also, to check the ethics and integrity of fund managers. This may be done via background checks, education verifications, reference checks.\\

To see how a quant manager fits with rest of portfolio, the key is to build a diversified portfolio that considers three important elements:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Various types of alpha exposures
\item Various bet structures
\item Various time horizons
\end{enumerate}
