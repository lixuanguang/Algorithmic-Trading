\subsection{Overview of Systematic Investments}

The figure below illustrates a live, production-level trading strategy. (Note that the diagram does not include ancillary components—such as research tools—that are also essential for building a complete strategy.)

At its core, the trading system is organized into three primary modules:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Alpha Model:} Predicts the future behavior of the instruments under consideration, thereby generating directional alpha.
\item \textbf{Risk Model:} Limits exposure by controlling risk factors that might not generate returns but could lead to losses (i.e., by setting directional exposure limits on asset classes).
\item \textbf{Transaction Cost Model:} Assesses whether the trading costs required to transition from the current portfolio to a new one are acceptable within the portfolio construction framework.
\end{enumerate}

These models feed into a portfolio construction model that balances profitability and risk to determine the optimal portfolio configuration. This model identifies the necessary trade adjustments, which are then executed by the system.

The execution model receives the required trades and, based on inputs such as trade urgency and current market liquidity, carries out the transactions in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

\begin{method} \hlt{Chains of Production for Alpha Signals}\\
The production process for generating alpha signals consists of the following stages:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item \textbf{Data Curation:} Involves collecting, cleaning, indexing, storing, adjusting, and delivering data to the production pipeline. This stage requires expertise in market microstructure and data protocols (e.g., FIX).
\item \textbf{Feature Analysis:} Converts raw data into meaningful signals through techniques in information theory, signal extraction, visualization, labeling, weighting, classification, and feature importance assessment. Feature analysts compile and catalogue these insights.
\item \textbf{Strategy Development:} Transforms informative features into actionable investment algorithms. Strategists mine feature libraries for ideas, blending deep financial market knowledge with data science to develop transparent (white-box) strategies—even if some features originate from black-box methods.
\item \textbf{Back-Testing:} Evaluates the investment strategy under various scenarios. This process demands rigorous empirical analysis and includes metadata on how the strategy was formulated.
\item \textbf{Deployment:} Integrates the strategy code into the production system. This step is managed by algorithm specialists and mathematical programmers to ensure fidelity to the prototype while minimizing latency.
\item \textbf{Portfolio Oversight:} Monitors the strategy post-deployment throughout its lifecycle:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \item \textbf{Embargo:} Initially, the strategy is run on post-backtest data. If performance is consistent with backtesting, the strategy advances to the next phase.
  \item \textbf{Paper Trading:} The strategy is executed on a live feed, simulating real trading conditions. This phase accounts for data parsing, calculation delays, execution lags, and other operational latencies.
  \item \textbf{Graduation:} The strategy is allocated real capital, either individually or as part of an ensemble, with detailed evaluations of risk, returns, and costs.
  \item \textbf{Re-allocation:} Allocations are dynamically adjusted based on live performance. Initial allocations are small and may be increased as the strategy proves itself, with a subsequent reduction if performance declines.
  \item \textbf{Decommission:} If the strategy underperforms over an extended period, it is phased out.
